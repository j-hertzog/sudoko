To-do list for sudoko:

*1. Verify we have a 9x9 table

2. Check each row and col for unique 1-9 values
	*-check for spaces: means we have an incomplete table
	
	-cols:
		use a hashset to verify unique values
			-simplify current hashset process into a single function that takes a string as input so we can use for both rows and cols checking
	-rows:
		-populate a 2d array use above hashset method
		-we can use this 2d array for both rows and cols checking (simplification)

3. Create a nonet of 3x3 grids

4. Verify only one of each # in the nonet
	-check for spaces?

5. Check to see if the sum of each nonet(3x3grid) is equal to 45
